# kupumaori
An interactive command-line "flashcard" program, for drilling MƒÅori vocab.

Requires the [readchar](https://pypi.org/project/readchar/) module. Install it with `pip` via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Should work in both Python 2 and Python 3. Will probably only work on *nix systems.
